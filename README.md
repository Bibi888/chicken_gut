# Culture collection of intestinal microorganisms
The present repository contains a workflow of the analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacteria isolated from the Upper digestive system of chicken and cultivated under anaerobic conditions.

The files include the following workflow scripts:

-Assembly, annotation and taxonomic assignation of WGS
-Large scale comparison and relative abundance estimation of single genomes against metagenomic samples
-Functional interactions of synthetic microbial communities assesed by metaproteomics
-Quantification of the expression of the endopeptidase pepO in species of Lactobacillaceae
